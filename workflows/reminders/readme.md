## Reminders Alfred Workflow

[Download Reminders for Alfred](https://github.com/rknightuk/alfred-workflows/raw/main/workflows/reminders/reminders.alfredworkflow)

The CLI is based on a modified version of [keith/reminders-cli](https://github.com/keith/reminders-cli) and a modified version of date parsing code from [surrealroad/alfred-reminders](https://github.com/surrealroad/alfred-reminders). View the [modified CLI here](https://github.com/rknightuk/alfred-reminders-helper).

NB: On first run, you'll get a warning about running an app from an unidentified developer. You have to open Preferences > Security and Privacy > General, then click "Allow".

- View upcoming reminders (either all of them or for a specific list)
- Create new reminders for either your default list (set the variable on install) or for a specific list (`rmind` > Lists > Choose List > Create New Reminder)
- View reminders with no due date (`rmind` > Lists > Choose List > Show any time reminders)
- Mark reminders complete from any of these views
