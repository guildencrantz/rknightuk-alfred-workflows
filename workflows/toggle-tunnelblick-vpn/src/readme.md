### What does it do?

This workflow toggles one single VPN connection in [Tunnelblick](https://tunnelblick.net/). Set the `vpn_to_toggle` variable to the name of the VPN you want to toggle. 

I only use one VPN, so this is perfect for what I needed. If you want to manage more than one VPN connection I recommend Alfred VPN Manager [alfred-vpn-manager](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-vpn-manager).

Keyword is `vpn`
