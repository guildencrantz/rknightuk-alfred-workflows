# My Alfred Workflows

[Alfred workflows](https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/) I've made, ones that I use, and a script to automatically export mine.

Icons from [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com)

## Setting up the backup script

[`backup.sh`](backup.sh) generates this readme file as well as backing up my workflows (and only mine, don't post other peoples workflows to your own repositories). The script works by doing the following:

- Looping through all workflows in my Alfred workflow directory
- If it has my bundle ID in the plist file, it extracts the metadata using `PListBuddy`, adds it to the first list below, then zips the workflow as an `.alfredworkflow`
- If it doesn't have my bundle ID, then it gets the name, author and website and puts them in the second list below

See the comments in the script to set this up for your own workflows

This part of the readme is set in `readme.example`
